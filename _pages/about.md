**IntelliGuard** research group is affiliated with the [THETA Lab](http://jxd308.cn/), [School of Computer Science and Technology](http://en.scit.bjtu.edu.cn/) at [Beijing Jiaotong University](https://en.bjtu.edu.cn/). 
<!-- Our group is comprised of faculty with a wide range of expertise, including: [Prof. Zhen Han](https://faculty.bjtu.edu.cn/5608/) (Information Security, Trusted Computing), [Prof. Jiqiang Liu](https://faculty.bjtu.edu.cn/6279/) (Privacy Preserving, Cryptographic Protocols), [Prof. Wenjia Niu](https://faculty.bjtu.edu.cn/9120/) (AI Security) and [Dr. Endong Tong](https://faculty.bjtu.edu.cn/9306/) (Reinforcement Learning, Data Mining). -->
Our group is dedicated to conducting in-depth research in the field of intelligent systems security, focusing on security/privacy issues in emerging AI/systems/network technologies, especially the latest ones with high societal impacts such as those powering the emerging AI-enabled autonomous cars/robots, intelligent transportation, etc.

Our group's main research interests are as follows:
- **Applications of Large Language Models (LLMs)**: Leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) within an End-to-End autonomous driving systems.
- **Security in CPS/IoT**: Addressing vulnerabilities and potential attacks targeting the physical world, sensors, algorithms, and autonomous driving systems.
- **Safety & Robustness in Reinforcement Learning**: Developing methods for ensuring safety and robustness in Reinforcement Learning algorithms tailored for autonomous driving systems.
- **Scenario and Image Generation**: Exploring techniques for generating images and videos, with a particular emphasis on generative data augmentation (GDA) in autonomous driving scenarios.
